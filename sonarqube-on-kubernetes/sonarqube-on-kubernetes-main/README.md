Deploying Databases (PostgreSQL)
Create configuration of Persistent Volume Claim and Deployment for PostgreSQL. You can skip this step if you‚Äôre using an external service like a fully managed database service, etc.


And this is my YAML configuration for PostgreSQL deployment, don‚Äôt forget to set up the PostgreSQL credential in the config map section, we‚Äôll use it later on Sonar YAML.


Deploying Application
Let‚Äôs start with create a configuration of Persistent Volume Claim used by SonarQube


Now we‚Äôll create a Deployment configuration for SonarQube. At this stage, we need to do a little trick in configuring SonarQube. One of the configurations needed to run SonarQube in a Linux environment is to increase the maximum amount of virtual memory by changing the value of max_map_countto 524288. If SonarQube is deployed on a VM, this might not be a big deal as we can change it permanently. But in Kubernetes, it takes a bit of an extra step so this configuration can continue to be applied when pods are created. We can do this by adding a step initContainer in the Deployment template. In this step, we‚Äôll deploy busybox and run the max_map_countconfiguration. I use the value 262144as the minimum required virtual memory to running SonarQube.

The configuration that we need also to pay attention to is the database connection settings. Official SonarQube image parameter using JDBC URL format to set the database connection. You can see the example below

‚Äújdbc:postgresql://postgres:5432/sonar_db‚Äù
postgresvalue is based on PostgreSQL container name in Kubernetes environment, we can access the container by using the container name. Change it to your defined container name.
sonar_db value is based on POSTGRESQL_DATABASEwhat we define on the Postgres config map

Deploying Ingress
After the deployment configuration is applied, create an ingress to expose the service. In this step, I will use ingress with the Nginx controller. Deploying an Nginx controller is not too difficult because you can follow the steps in their documentation. Let‚Äôs start by adding a secret for the SSL certificates, you‚Äôll need the SSL key and the SLL certificate.

This step is not required if you want to expose the SonarQube in HTTP protocol. You can just remove the tlssection in the Ingress YAML and apply it.

kubectl create secret tls my-fancy-certs ‚Äî key ssl.key ‚Äî cert ssl.crt -n sonar
after the secret is created, configure ingress with the Nginx class


And, here we go! just do some quick setup and your sonar is ready to use.

Closing
by installing SonarQube in the Kubernetes environment, we can easily maintain the version we are using. Simply by changing the image tag on the Deployment specs, and voila*!

*Please make sure you read the Release Upgrade Notes to prevent something unwanted

Another thigs to notes is if you‚Äôre application compiled in Java 15 environment, make sure you using Jacoco at least version 0.8.7(If you using Jacoco for code coverage reporting), because the Jacoco with version below 0.8.7 doesn‚Äôt support Java 15 yet.

In Gradle, you can add the following line to define the Jacoco version :

jacoco {
    toolVersion = ‚Äú0.8.7‚Äù
